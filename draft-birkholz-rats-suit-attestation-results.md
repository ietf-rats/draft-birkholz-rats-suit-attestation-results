--- abstract
The IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture defines an output of the appraisal process that assesses trustworthiness of remote peers: Attestation Results. Based on the Trustworthiness Vectors defined in Trusted Path Routing, this document defines a core set of Claims representing Attestation Results for the SUIT Workflow Model. Consecutively, this document is in support of the Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) architecture, which defines the assessment of remote peers via RATS and uses SUIT as a remediation measure to improve trustworthiness of given remote peers.
