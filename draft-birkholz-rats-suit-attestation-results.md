--- abstract

The IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture defines Conceptual Messages as input and output of the appraisal process that assesses the trustworthiness of remote peers: Evidence and Attestation Results.
Based on the Trustworthiness Vectors defined in Trusted Path Routing, this document defines a core set of Claims to be used in Evidence and Attestation Results for the Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) Workflow Model.
Consecutively, this document is in support of the Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) architecture, which defines the assessment of remote peers via RATS and uses SUIT for evidence generation and as a remediation measure to improve trustworthiness of given remote peers.

# Introduction

Attestation Results are an essential output of Verifiers as defined in the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture {{-rats}}.
They are consumed by Relying Parties: the entities that intend to build future decisions on trustworthiness assessments of remote peers.
Attestation Results must be easily digestable by Relying Parties -- in contrast to the rather complex or domain-specific Evidence digested by Verifiers.

In order to create Attestation Results a Verifier must consume Evidence generated by a given Attester (amongst other Conceptual Messages, such as Endorsements and Attestation Policies).
Both Evidence and Attestation Results are composed of Claims.
This document highlights and defines a set of Claims to be used in Evidence and Attestation Results that are based on the SUIT Workflow Model {{-suit}}.

## SUIT Workflow Model and Procedures

This document focuses on Evidence and Attestation Results that can be generated based on the output of SUIT Procedures.
The SUIT Workflow Model allows for two types of SUIT Procedures generating Reports on the Attester as defined in the SUIT Manifest specification:

Update Procedures:

: A procedure that updates a device by fetching dependencies, software images, and installing them

: An Update Procedure creates a Report on mutable software components that are installed or updated on hardware components.

Boot Procedures:

: A procedure that boots a device by checking dependencies and images, loading images, and invoking one or more image

: A Boot Procedure creates a Report on measured boot events (e.g. during Secure Boot).

The Records contained in each type of Report can be used as Claims in Evidence Generation on the Attester as described in this document.
Analogously, the corresponding Verifier appraising that Evidence can create Attestation Results using the Claims defined in this document.

Both SUIT Procedures pass several stages (e.g. dependency-checking is one stage).
The type and sequence of stages are defined by the Command Sequences included in a SUIT Manifest.
For each stage in which a Command from the Command Sequence is executed a Record is created. All Records of a SUIT procedure contain binary results limited to "fail" or "pass".
The aggregated sequence of all Records is composed into a Report.

This document specifies new Claims derived from Command Sequence Reports and highlights existing Claims as defined in Trusted Path Routing {{-tpr}} that are applicable to the operational state of installed and updated software.

The Claims defined in this document are in support of the Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) architecture. During TEEP, the current operational state of an Attester is assessed via RATS. If the corresponding Attestation Results -- as covered in this document -- indicate insufficient Trustworthiness Levels with respect to installed software, the SUIT Workflow Model is used for remediation.

## Terminology

This document uses the terms and concepts defined in {{-rats}}, {{-suit}}, and {{-teep}}.

# Trustworthiness Vectors

While there are usage scenarios where Attestation Results can be a binary decisions, more often than not the assessment of trustworthiness is a fine grained spectrum or based on multiple factors. These shades of Attestation Results are captured by the definition of Trustworthiness Vectors in Trusted Path Routing {{-tpr}}. Trustworthiness Vectors are sets of Claims representing appraisal outputs created by a Verifier. Each of these Claims is called a Trustworthiness Level. Multiple Trustworthiness Level are composed into a vector.
